FIX
===

The Clear FIX api is based on the FIX Protocol, with some modifications.

On the docs directory, you can find:

* Details about our FIX specification (ClearFIXApi.pdf) 
* The data dictionary (fix44.xml)
* And out certification routine, wich provides a more funcional description of the api. Also, it can give to you a glance of what you should expect on the certification process.


Also, we provide a small example of a Clear FIX's compliant client on the Client.
